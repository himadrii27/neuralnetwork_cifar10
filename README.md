Developed and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes, achieving an accuracy of approximately 70%. The CNN architecture included convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by fully connected layers with ReLU and softmax activations.
Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as normalizing pixel values and reshaping target labels for improved model performance. Utilized scikit-learn for model evaluation, including generating classification reports and confusion matrices to assess model accuracy and performance across multiple classes.
